    <h2>Game rules</h2>
    <div>
    <p>
    In Twenty-one, the goal is to get a hand with a total value closer to 21 than the dealer's (i.e. banker's) hand without going over 21.
    Cards 2 to 10 have the value corresponding to their number, jacks have the value 11, queens have the value 12 and kings have the value 13
    and aces can count as either 1 or 14 whichever is more beneficial to the player.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game starts by showing the empty board.
        The player gets to play first and take the first card.
        After this, the player can decide to stay or take another card.
        In total, the player may take two cards.
        If the player gets over 21, the dealer wins.
        If the player gets under 21, it's the dealer's turn.
        The dealer can then pick one or two cards.
        The player wins if the dealer gets over 21 or if his hand is closer to 21.
        The dealer wins if his hand is closer to 21 or if both hands are equal.
